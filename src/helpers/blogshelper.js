      "Meditation is an effective technique that has been around for centuries. People who meditate consistently find that there are short-term and long-term benefits. For instance, soon after they start sitting, meditators begin to enjoy a decrease in stress and anxiety, enhanced well-being, and, in many cases, improved sleep and overall health. In the long term, meditators are better able to understand how the mind works and how to work with their minds.\n\n\n Until recently, serious meditators generally belonged to one of two categories. They either joined a monastery or ashram and devoted their lives to practice; or they left the hustle-bustle of the worldly life behind and sought refuge in the serenity of isolated hermitages. But we can find a way to meditate within our everyday lifestyle. Nowadays, however, many people who lead active lives – work, family, school, etc. – are willing to devote time and energy to meditation because they are convinced of the benefits. Some do their daily meditation sessions in groups, but far more are now meditating at home. \n\nAre you meditating because you want to manage stress, sleep better, or cope with chronic pain? If so, you may do well with guided meditation, relaxation meditation, or chanting. Are you looking to gain insights into the mind? This is the true goal of mindfulness and awareness meditation. Is your primary objective to develop qualities such as patience, empathy and generosity? Gratitude meditation is a good choice (if you can do a morning gratitude meditation it can benefit your whole day). Do you want to go deeper into your relationship with the divine presence? Spiritual meditation can take you there.",
